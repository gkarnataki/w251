## HW06

## Steps Followed
The notebook was first run on P100 and then on V100 by following the instructions in the HW06 page. A submission was then made to Kaggle as a part of the answer to Section 8
Note that this section is only present in the P100 notebook as that was executed first. I did not repeat these steps on the V100 notebook.
Both notebooks have been uploaded here.  

## Training Runtimes:  
V100:     Approx 3 hr 20 mins  
P100:     > 6 Hours
